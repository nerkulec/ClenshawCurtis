# Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature
We consider the problem of numerical integration.  
A particular method called the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature is presented, explained and then evaluated.  
An efficient implementation in Julia is also provided as well as benchmarking code which shows off 
its effectiveness and limitations. A brief discussion of numerical results follows.
